# What is this??

This is a little project I made in two days as a "fancy" way to send some cute Valentine's day messages to my friends and show them appreciation. It's an app to format, encrypt and package some data to later be decrypted, parsed and shown as some components.

**tl;dr** a way to send messages fairly securely, which I over-engineered to send cute messages to my friends.

The project's name is see-you, [which I got from a song in one of my Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/track/6Z8DtqjMc5TWN1PSws8JrF?si=384b415decfd4269), and it has almost no correlation to the project itself apart from the song fitting a Valentine's day theme, and it being about love (I think so at least ðŸ˜…).
